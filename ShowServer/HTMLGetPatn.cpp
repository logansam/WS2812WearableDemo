    There are 3 magic predefined states:

        HTTPSTART: 
            This is a required state to have.
            This is always the starting state and the first state
            in your compose function.

        HTTPDISCONNECT:
            Not a required state to have, but this state will be called whenever
            your conneciton is closed. This will always be called even if you
            return GCMD::DONE requesting the connection to be closed. This is
            nice because you can do clean up steps here, because no matter how
            the connection was closed, you get a chance to clean up.

        HTTPTIMEOUT:
            This is not a required state to have.
            This is called if the connection timed out, that is, the connection was
            made, your compose function got called but some pending data did not come in.
            For example if you returned a GCMD::GETLINE yet a line never came in.

/***    GCMD::ACTION ComposeHTMLSamplePage(CLIENTINFO * pClientInfo)
 *
 *    Parameters:
 *          pClientInfo - the client info representing this connection and web page
 *              
 *    Return Values:
 *          GCMD::ACTION    - GCMD::CONTINUE, just return with no outside action
 *                          - GCMD::READ, non-blocking read of input data into the rgbIn buffer appended to the end of rgbIn[] which has a predefined size of 256 bytes
 *                              when we return to this compose function cbRead will have the number of bytes read, and likely could be zero.
 *                          - GCMD::GETLINE, blocking read until a line of input is read or until the rgbIn buffer is full, always the line starts at the beginnig of the rgbIn
 *                              cbRead has the number of bytes read
 *                          - GCMD::WRITE, loop writing until all cbWrite bytes are written from the pbOut buffer
 *                              pbOut can point to any valid buffer that will remain unchanged until execution returns to this function. We could get a TIMOUT
 *                              if we can't write the data. cbWritten will have the number of bytes actually written. As part of each connection there is a 
 *                              scratch buffer of 256 provide at rgbOut; it is optional to point pbOut to rgbOut. PbOut can point anywhere and that is what will be written
 *                              cbWrite must be set to the number of bytes to write.
 *                          - GCMD::DONE, we are done processing and the connection can be closed
 *
 *    Description: 
 *    
 *      This composes the sample HTML page
